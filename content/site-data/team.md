      Full-stack software development is my passion and feeds a deep creative
      drive to build apps that improve efficiency, communication, ROI, and
      social impact.


      An extensive background in marketing and technical sales honed a creative, analytical, and adaptable mindset that achieved high goals for my clients and business.


      Throughout my career I have been known as the "tech geek" and "new idea guy". Forever on the hunt to improve efficiency, I built custom apps to improve communication and ROTI for both my clients and colleagues.


      As full-stack developer, I have built dozens of sites and apps using MongoDB, MySQL, Express, React, Vue, Node, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, PHP, Bootstrap and WordPress.
