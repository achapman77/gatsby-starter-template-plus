      strategic objectives. Having lost friends and colleagues in the line of
      duty, John has an intimate knowledge of the impact limited access to
      resources and advanced training can have on the battlefield. John is
      intensely focused and driven to overcome the educational and training
      challenges that directly affect the quality of medical care provided to
